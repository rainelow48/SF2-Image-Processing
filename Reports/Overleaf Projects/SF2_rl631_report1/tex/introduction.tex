\section*{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

In this project, we aim to design an image compression scheme to achieve high compression rates while preserving the image quality. This report focuses on basic image filtering with a half-cosine pulse, the use of the Laplacian pyramid for image compression, as well as the quantisation schemes for efficient coding.
