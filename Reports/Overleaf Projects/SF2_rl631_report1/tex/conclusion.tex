\section*{Conclusion}

The constant MSE scheme gives a better performance than the constant step size and is found to plateau after 2 layers, while the constant step size scheme has the best performance with a pyramid layer of 2. A longer filter is also found to give a poorer performance as more energy is stored in the high-pass images.
