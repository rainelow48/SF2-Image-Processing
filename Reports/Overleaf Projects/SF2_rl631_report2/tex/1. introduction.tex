In this project, we aim to design an image compression scheme to achieve high compression rates while preserving the image quality. This report focuses on transform-based methods - Discrete Cosine Transform, Lapped Bi-orthogonal Transform, and Discrete Wavelet Transform - and their respective quantisation and coding efficiencies. A key advantage of transform-based methods is that there is no expansion of the number of samples, unlike the Laplacian Pyramid, which generally improves the compression ratio \footnote{Compression ratio: Total number of bits for the reference scheme/Total number of bits for the compressed scheme}.
